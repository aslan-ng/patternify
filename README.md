```bash
git clone https://github.com/aslan-ng/patternify.git
```

## Usage
1. Put your input image in the directory.
2. Run main.py with your desired parameters. As a result, a .txt will be generated in the project's root path.
3. Use your 2D/3D modeling software to run its specific script. That script will use the .txt file from last step to draw the shape.
