# patternify
Converting images to beautiful vector-based patterns, useful for 2D and 3D design.
Exceptionally useful for artistic laser and water jet cutting projects.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aslan-ng/patternify.git
```
2. Put your input image in the directory.
3. Run main.py with your desired parameters. As a result, a .txt will be generated in the project's root path.
4. Use your 2D/3D modeling software to run its specific script. That script will use the .txt file from last step to draw the shape.
